## Overview

`complexR` is a tool for easily computing and visualizing
transformations on complex numbers:

- `circle_transform()` performs and visualizes any kind of
  transformation on circles

- `line_transform()` performs and visualizes any kind of transformation
  on lines

- `quad_transform()` performs and visualizes any kind of transformation
  on squares and rectangles

- `plane_to_sphere()` and `sphere_to_plane()` compute stereographic
  projections

- `st_sphere_plot()` and `st_plane_plot()` visualize them.

These functions combine other intermediary functions like
`cart_to_polar()` and `polar_to_cart()` to execute their operations. You
can learn more about them in `vignette("complexR")`.
